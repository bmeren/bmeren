- 👋 Hi, I’m @bmeren
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and language learning. I really like to combine the two sometimes because my background in learning other languages translates pretty well
to learning computer languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Chinese and Korean. I have already learned python, java, and php but I always want to practice them more to refine what I have already learned.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am almost done earning a bachelor's degree in software development and am itching to use it.
- 📫 You can reach me via email or phone number,
          email: bm1371@messiah.edu
          phone:1(717)891-9737
